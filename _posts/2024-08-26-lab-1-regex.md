Please consult the following text document - [https://lccn.loc.gov/2016959361/marcxml][regex-example] - and answer the questions below using regular expressions:

1. How many subfield entries are there?
2. How could you find ISO-8601 formatted dates (using regular expressions)? (In other words, provide the regex that would match such a date.)
3. How would you find an ISBN number? Are there any ISBN numbers?
4. How many occurrences of computer (singular, plural, upper-lower)?
5. Are there any web addresses in the text? How many?
6. Can you isolate the domains and protocol designations of the web addresses? (That is, are they http? https? Are they www? Another? .com? .gov? etc)

Please record your answers in a text file and directly upload on Canvas (https://umich.instructure.com/courses/698670/assignments/2472578).

Please use the resources linked in the module for week 1 to review the fundamentals of regular expressions. Remember that you can use a tool like [regex101.com](https://regex101.com/) to answer the above questions, or you can use the regular expression search feature in VSCode.
