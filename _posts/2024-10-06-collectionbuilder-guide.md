This page contains tips and pointers for working with CollectionBuilder.
CollectionBuilder provides code that generates a static site using the
Jekyll static site platform.

## Item Metadata

The CollectionBuilder documentation has two useful templates that you can
use to format metadata for the objects in your collection. While these are
very useful for demonstration purposes, it is also helpful to have an
idea about what these various fields are, where they are displayed on the site,
and some general conventions or usage guidelines.
This section offers some more detailed information about these aspects of CollectionBuilder metadata.

## Useful Links

While this page will provide some insight on frequently asked questions,
you should use the excellent documentation from the CollectionBuilder
project. If you have been able to
a) create and publish your own Jekyll site from GitHub, and
b) pull metadata from the Library of Congress API,
then their documentation should be sufficient to get your own
Collection Builder site going:

* CollectionBuilder: [CSV Walkthrough](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/walkthroughs/csv-walkthrough/)
* CollectionBuilder: [Creating Digital Derivatives](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/walkthroughs/derivatives-walkthrough/) from original digital files
* CollectionBuilder: [Working with GitHub](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/walkthroughs/gh-walkthrough/)
