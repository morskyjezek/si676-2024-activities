SI 676 is a course titled "Networked Services for Libraries, Archives, and Museums"
that is offered by the [University of Michigan School of Information](https://www.si.umich.edu/)
in the Fall 2024 term.

The site is built on the serverless GitHub Pages framework,
which publishes static site frameworks using GitHub.
This site uses the Jekyll site generator, which
is supported by GitHub.
Jekyll generates a set of HTML pages according to
a set of text files and configuration files,
which are organized and created by the site creator to
provide content and structure for an HTML site that
is published to the Web.
